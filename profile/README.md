## üçøDescription :

This project aims to develop an AI-driven personal financial advisor application designed to provide users with comprehensive information about various investment types. This information can support users in making their own investment decisions. The application will leverage artificial intelligence to analyze user preferences and suggest suitable investment types, thereby personalizing the investment experience. It will cover a range of investment options such as gold, bonds, mutual funds, stocks, stock indexes and cryptocurrencies.

The importance of this project lies in its potential for economic empowerment. By providing individuals with the knowledge and tools to make informed investment decisions, we can boost personal economic growth. This, in turn, can contribute to societal economic development as more individuals become financially literate and independent.

This project holds significant value for any organization or stakeholder invested in promoting financial literacy and economic growth. It aligns with the broader goals of financial inclusion and democratization of investment opportunities.
